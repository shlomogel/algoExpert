## âœ” Two Number Sum
  ðŸ’» twoNumberSum.py
  
  Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an
  integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum
  up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any
  order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return
  an empty array.
  
## âœ” Validate Subsequence
  ðŸ’» isValidSubsequence.py
  
  Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
  whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
  
## âœ” Sorted Squared Array
  ðŸ’» sortedSquaredArray.py
  
  Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted
  in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares
  of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.
  
## âœ” Tournament Winner
  ðŸ’» tournamentWinner.py
  
  There's an algorithms tournament taking place in which teams of programmers
  compete against each other to solve algorithmic problems as fast as possible.
  Teams compete in a round robin, where each team faces off against all other
  teams. Only two teams compete against each other at a time, and for each
  competition, one team is designated the home team, while the other team is the
  away team. In each competition there's always one winner and one loser; there
  are no ties. A team receives 3 points if it wins and 0 points if it loses. The
  winner of the tournament is the team that receives the most amount of points.
  
  Given an array of pairs representing the teams that have competed against each
  other and an array containing the results of each competition, write a
  function that returns the winner of the tournament. The input arrays are named
